# HELLO WORLD

In these modern times, current-generation languages offer all kinds of features that didn’t exist in 1972 when C was invented. 
This means C is a pretty basic language with not a lot of features. It can do anything, but it can make you work for it.

/* Hello world program */

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("Hello, World!\n");  // Actually do the work here
}

#include? It tells the C Preprocessor to pull the contents of another file and insert it into the code right there.

There are two stages to compilation: 
The preprocessor and the compiler. 
Anything that starts with pound sign, or “octothorpe”, (#) is something the preprocessor operates on before the compiler even gets started. Common preprocessor directives, as they’re called, are #include and #define.

preprocessor -> output -> compiler -> executable

<stdio.h>? That is what is known as a header file. This gives us access to all the functionality in the file during the preprocessor phase i.e printf

## 2.3

JavaScript and Python devs aren’t used to a separate compilation step at all–though behind the scenes it’s happening! 
Python compiles your source code into something called bytecode that the Python virtual machine can execute. 
Java devs are used to compilation, but that produces bytecode for the Java Virtual Machine.

When compiling C, machine code is generated. This is the 1s and 0s that can be executed directly and speedily by the CPU.

For this book, I compile programs for C2x with all warnings set:

gcc -Wall -Wextra -std=c2x -pedantic foo.c
